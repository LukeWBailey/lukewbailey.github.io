This is a line of text. I wonder how far it will go off the screen. Hopefully it wraps around, otherwise the page will look ridiculous. That’s not to say that all paragraphs have to look the same, some of them might look quite different from the others. But, that being said, I do want to see what one long paragraph will look like.
