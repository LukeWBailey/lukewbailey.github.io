**Name**: Squill

**Colour**: Brown

**Description**: Often found on beaches, a squill is a creature well-known for its tendency to prickle or stick to feet. The squills are tiny - smaller than the size of a closed fist - and enjoy lying in sandy locations to take in sunlight and drink sea water. They are hard to spot, being the same colour as the sand that surrounds them, and rarely moving during the day. The top of their body is covered in sharp spikes, while their bottoms are covered in a sticky substance oozing from tiny holes in their skin. It’s said to be good luck if you step on a squill’s sticky side, but bad luck if you step on their spikes. Either way, the squill usually gets crushed - so it’s never good luck for them.

**Habitat**: Beaches

**Uses**: Squills are not a good food source, as their bodies mostly consist of sand and water.

**Sound**: Squeaky

**Name**: Glibber

**Colour**: Transparent

**Description**: A glibber is a large creature with a bulging gelatinous head full of liquid. Underneath the transparent surface of its transparent fleshy skin, you can see pulsing veins and floating white balls of unidentifiable mass inside. The creature stands upright on three serpent-like tentacles, that slither along the ground. The creature has no eyes, but instead feels its way along the dirt. At its very bottom, at the center of the tentacles, is a small mouth that acts like a suction vacuum. The glibber picks up small insects using its suction, which then get pulled up into its head to be dissolved for their nutrients.

**Habitat**: Grassy plains

**Uses**: If you cut a glibber open, the liquid that fills its head can be used with water to clean clothes and dishes.

**Sounds**: Slurping
