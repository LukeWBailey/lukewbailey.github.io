I’ve decided to build a world.

Not physically, of course. I don’t have the upper arm strength for that.

I want to build a world, but just in my mind. And by typing some words on my laptop.

Still, it **will** be an entire world. I’m going to shape its landscapes, design some animals and plants to populate it, and form the people who live there. I’ll create their laws, develop their culture, understand their economy, mock their beliefs, and discover the way they live their lives.

I want to know how their food tastes, the holidays they celebrate, the types of music they listen to, the books they read, how they communicate with each other, how they raise children, what they think is beautiful, what they’re scared of, and what happens when they die.

And what will I do with this world?

Well, I’m not sure yet… But I do have some ideas.

First things first though, every world needs a name.

And I’m going to call mine… Olivine.
