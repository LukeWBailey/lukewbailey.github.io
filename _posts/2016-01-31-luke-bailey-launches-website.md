**Introduction**

*“The Internet is terrifying. It’s vast, it’s dangerous, and it can’t be controlled.”*

Those were the fears of previous generations, the fears of my parents and my teachers. Back in the 90’s, the Internet was like a piece of art in a museum. You could look at, amuse yourself with it, or even learn from it - but you must never “touch” it.

Online interactions were dangerous, especially for children.

Now, of course, that way of thinking has become antiquated. We “touch” the Internet in more ways than ever, with social media, online dating, and blogging. But with all of this interactive content, we’ve uncovered a new type of Internet danger.

**Paralyzed by Permanence**

*“The Internet is written in ink. It’s permanent.”*

Actually, I think the metaphor can be taken even further. Every post we make, every update we post, every Tweet we send out into the void becomes like a tattoo on our digital bodies.

For most people, a couple hundred tattoos are really no problem. Some photos of your shenanigans in college might be embarrassing, but there’s probably nothing so outrageous you’ll remember to go back and delete. Because unlike the tattoos we get on our bodies in real life, our digital bodies are stretched across multiple websites and accounts. It takes a lot of hard work to connect the dots, and nobody should really have any reason to do so. 

But they are still out there. Every post you make is printed on your digital body, ready to be scrutinized and judged if the Internet ever casts its eyes on you. 

Trevor Noah is a recent example of this. Last year, he was announced as the new host of The Daily Show. Within 24 hours, he faced an [intense backlash](http://time.com/3764913/trevor-noah-twitter-backlash/) after bloggers and journalists dug back into his Twitter history to uncover jokes that were “sexist” and “anti-semitic.”

His Tweets were like some of his old tattoos, and they were not flattering.

**A Writer’s Perspective**

So how do I fit into all of this? I’m a professional writer, of sorts, and I have creative ambitions. Here’s the thing though - I’m not all that good at writing fiction yet. I’ve been practicing for a few years, and I feel like I’m getting better. But I’m still at the stage of my life where I consider most sentences I write to be mildly embarrassing.

There’s always this fear that if I post something online now, it will be discovered years from now. Some future journalist or blogger will dig into my life, and realize I posted all of this terrible content. “Can you believe he wrote a blog post about the permanence of the Internet? It’s so slight and pedantic!” My early writing could end up like a bunch of old tattoos I end up regretting.

Here’s the thing though - all of this assumes that I’ll become a good enough writer that someone will actually *want* to dig into my digital body of work. There are over 150 million blogs out there, and the vast majority of them never get seen by anyone. Chances are, in a few months or years time, this will just be another abandoned project.

Rather than worry about the future, I’ve decided to throw caution to the wind. Write like nobody’s watching.

Because chances are, nobody is.
