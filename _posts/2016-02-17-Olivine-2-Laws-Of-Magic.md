Yes, Olivine will have magic.

What’s the point of creating a new world if you’re not going to add a bit of magic to it? I’ve read my fair share of books with powers and spells in them - authors like Tolkien, Lewis, Bradbury, and Baum were big influences on me growing up.

When it comes to creating my own system of magic though, I want to make sure it holds up to scrutiny. There are two schools of thought when it comes to authors creating their own systems of magic - they either keep things mysterious and abstract, or concrete and explicit. Brandon Sanderson has a lot of interesting posts on this subject, and I’m going to borrow heavily from his ideas to set my system in place.

So, here we go: the laws of magic in Olivine.

**Law #1: Some words are magic.**

In the world of Olivine, performing magic is as simple as knowing the right words to say. Here’s how I imagine it: as the people developed their languages, they discovered certain, seemingly meaningless words had power.

Let’s use the word “Chara” as an example. Someone discovered that saying the word - which means absolutely nothing in their own language - could instantly change their appearance.

**Law #2: The power of words depends on their volume.**

Each word has three “levels” of power, that depend on how loud the speaker says them. Let’s go back to our example.

When someone says “Chara” in a whisper, they can change a specific part of their appearance. For example, they can elongate their nose, instantly grow a white beard, or change the colour of their eyes.

When someone says “Chara” at a normal volume, they can change their entire appearance. For example, they can transform into another person - even if it’s a different gender!

When someone yells “Chara” at top volume, they can change the appearance of something else. So, for example, they can make a common cow look like a dangerous beast. Or make a precious jewel look like a piece of coal.

**Law #3: The magic no longer works when a word is written down.**

Every good system of magic has a limitation, or a cost. In Olivine, once a magical word is written down - the magic no longer works.

There are thousands of these words that have powers, but most of them have already been written down. I imagine the government keeps books of “forbidden” words locked away to make sure they hold no power.

When someone discovers a new word, they have to weigh how often and loudly they say it. Every time they do so in public, they risk someone else overhearing and being able to take their powers away.

**Law #4: Writing can be destroyed to restore powers.**

So, let’s say the government has forbidden spell books locked away. If someone were to sneak in and burn them all, the power of those words could become potent once again.

And that could be very dangerous, for everyone.
